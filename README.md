#Smite API

## Purpose

This app is intended to be a microservice run on, and accessed by, a local network.

This app will probably need https and CORS if extended out to broader users.

## Installing

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Copy `auth.json.dist` into the root directory without the .dist.
* Put your smite api credentials into `auth.json`
* To start, run `node index.js`
